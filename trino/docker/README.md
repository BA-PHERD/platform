# Requirements

The image requires:

- The `rootCA.crt` file, which is generated by following the instructions in `../https/README.md`.
- The `trino-plugin-folder` with all the dependencies of trino plugin for ranger. Read `../ranger-plugin-conf/README.md`

---

## Extra (NOT REQUIRED)

In order to build Trino container, you need to locally build it from the `master`.

- Build it locally with Maven and Java 22.0.0+. I have used Java 23 (build 23+37-2369)

    ```bash
    cd {trino-repo}
    ./mvnw clean install -DskipTests
    ```

- Run the Docker build

    ```bash
    cd ./core/docker
    ./build.sh
    ```

The resulting image will be: `trino:{TRINO_VERSION}-SNAPSHOT-{ARCH}`.
